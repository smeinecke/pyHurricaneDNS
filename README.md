## What works?

- add (domain, record).
  - Support adding DDNS keys while adding new records.

- del (domain, record).
  - Using filter, delete all match records, **please handle with caution**.

- ls (domain, record)
- import (BIND zone files)
- cp (records from one domain to another)
- set (update a record by ID)
- show (export content of a zone)
- del_record (remove a record by ID)

## Usage

Get the party started by logging in:

```
hurricanedns <he.net username> <he.net password>
```

You'll get dropped to a `hurricanedns` command prompt:

```
[<username>@dns.he.net]
```

Start with `help`.

You can always get specific help for a command by doing `help [command]`, for example `help ls`

To quit, use `exit`, `EOF`, or CTRL-D.
